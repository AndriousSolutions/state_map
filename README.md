### The StateMap Mixin
Easily access a StatefulWidget's State object to call its **setState**().
Collects State Objects by their StatefulWidget objects into a Map object for reliable access across the app.
### Installing
I don't like the version number suggested on the [Installing](https://pub.dev/packages/state_map/install) page.
In most cases, always go up to the '**major**' semantic version number. In your pubspec.yaml file, type in the '**major**' semantic version number followed by two trailing zeros like so: '**.0.0**'
```javascript
dependencies:
 set_state: ^ 1.0.0
```
